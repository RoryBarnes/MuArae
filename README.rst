Orbital Modeling of the Mu Arae Planetary system
============

This repo contains the files used to generate the orbital dynamics results described in Benedict, G.F. et al. (2020). The results are divided into 1) rotating the system to the `invariable plane <InvPlane>`_ with `InvPlane <https://github.com/RoryBarnes/InvPlane>`_, 2) calculating `Hill stability <HillStability>`_ with `HillStability <https://github.com/RoryBarnes/HillStability>`_, and 3) `N-Body simulations <NBody>`_ of three- and four-planet solutions for the system with `VPLanet <https://github.com/VirtualPlanetaryLaboratory/vplanet>`_. See each directory for information on reproducing the published results.
